                <p>Actually, I more or less patterned it off of the Harry Potter series, when Rowling (or her editors) feel the need to recount exactly who Harry is in every book. Normally, this doesn't bug me since, for instance, someone could feasibly read any given Dresden Files book before Changes and thus a refresher on Dresden's character could be useful, but reading the Order of the Pheonix makes no sense without the preceeding books anyway, so why tell us about a character we've already known for 1,500 or so pages? More importantly, why is it always so bland?

                Anyway, that would be stuck in near the beginning of book four or five (but wouldn't be the opening paragraph or even in the opening chapter).

                He strained his ears, but heard nothing.

                Silence should be safe. Silence should tell him, even in the dark, that nothing approached him, that nothing nearby could hurt him. Nonetheless, he began to long for noise, especially for the noise of straight-forward confrontation. To fight an enemy directly would be a blessing compared to stumbling blind, searching for the voiceless, incoporeal monstrosity the already nearly destroyed him twice.
